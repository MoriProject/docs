## Base URL

```
https://morimori.app/api/v2
```

All endpoints are served over **HTTPS**. HTTP requests are not supported.

## Request format

Send requests with `Content-Type: application/json` and include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

## Response format

All responses return JSON. The shape depends on whether the request succeeded.

**Success**
```json
{
  "data": { ... }
}
```

Use the HTTP status code to identify the error category, and the `code` field for programmatic handling and localization. See [Error Codes](/errors) for the full list.
