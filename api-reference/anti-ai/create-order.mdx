## Download order results

Once your order reaches `complete` status, you can download the processed files.

<Accordion title="Download order results">
  Use the [Get download URL](/api-reference/orders/download-order) endpoint to retrieve a presigned download URL:

  ```bash
  curl -X GET https://morimori.app/api/v2/orders/{orderId}/download \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```

  <Warning>
    Order files are available for download for **up to 7 days** after order creation. After 7 days, the order transitions to `expired` status and files can no longer be downloaded.
