This guide walks you through creating an Anti-AI protection order — the most common use case. The same flow applies to Watermark Embed orders.

## Prerequisites

- A BIZ MORI API key ([get one here](https://developers.mori.art))
- An image file to protect (jpg, jpeg, png, or webp)

## Step 1: Create an order

Choose your preferred input mode:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Upload Mode">
    Create an order and receive presigned URLs for uploading files to S3.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://morimori.app/api/v2/orders/anti-ai \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "idempotencyKey": "my-first-order-001",
        "files": [
          { "fileName": "photo.jpg" }
        ],
        "options": {
          "strength": "high"
        }
      }'
    ```

    **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "orderName": "anti_ai_2026-02-19",
        "orderId": "123456789",
        "status": "pending",
        "files": [
          {
            "fileId": 1,
            "fileName": "photo.jpg",
            "uploadUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/...",
            "fileKey": "temp/123456789/0/photo.jpg"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="URL Mode">
    Provide image URLs directly — processing starts immediately without file upload.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://morimori.app/api/v2/orders/anti-ai \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "idempotencyKey": "my-first-order-001",
        "files": [
          {
            "fileName": "photo.jpg",
            "originalFileUrl": "https://your-server.com/photo.jpg"
          }
        ],
        "options": {
          "strength": "high"
        }
      }'
    ```

    **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "orderName": "anti_ai_2026-02-19",
        "orderId": "123456789",
        "status": "inProgress",
        "files": [
          {
            "fileId": 1,
            "fileName": "photo.jpg",
            "originalFileUrl": "https://your-server.com/photo.jpg"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    <Info>
      With URL mode, skip to [Step 4](#step-4-check-order-status) — no upload or confirm needed.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Upload files (Upload Mode only)

Upload your image to the presigned URL from the response:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://s3.amazonaws.com/..." \
  -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \
  --data-binary @photo.jpg
```

<Note>
  The presigned URL expires after a set time. If expired, use the [Refresh URLs](/api-reference/orders/refresh-urls) endpoint to get new ones.
</Note>

## Step 3: Confirm the order (Upload Mode only)

After uploading all files, confirm the order to start processing:

```bash
curl -X POST https://morimori.app/api/v2/orders/anti-ai/confirm \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "idempotencyKey": "my-confirm-001",
    "orderId": "123456789"
  }'
```

## Step 4: Check order status

Poll the order status or set up a [webhook](/webhooks) to receive notifications.

```bash
curl https://morimori.app/api/v2/orders/123456789 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

The order goes through these statuses:
- `pending` → Waiting for file upload
- `inProgress` → Processing
- `complete` → Done (ready for download)
- `failed` → Processing failed

## Step 5: Download the result

Once the status is `complete`, get the download URL:

```bash
curl https://morimori.app/api/v2/orders/123456789/download \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "downloadUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/...",
    "expiresIn": 3600
  }
}
```

Download the protected file using the presigned URL.
